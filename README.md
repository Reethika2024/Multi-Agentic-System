## 🧠 Enhancements in This Fork

This fork extends the original Multi-Agentic System with a focus on clarity,
observability, and ease of experimentation.

Key improvements include:

- Clearly documented responsibilities for each agent (Researcher, Analyzer, Writer, Supervisor)
- Improved readability of the agent execution flow and system architecture
- Added execution logging to improve observability and debugging
- Enhanced Streamlit interface to better reflect agent execution progress
- Laid the groundwork for configurable agent behavior and future extensions
